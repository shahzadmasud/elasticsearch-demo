A sample recipe search.

## Installing

You'll need [bower](http://bower.io/) to install the javascript dependencies.
After you get it, just run

    bower install

in the root directory.

You'll also need elasticsearch loaded up with recipes and accepting connections on
localhost:9200 for this example.

When all those ducks are in a row, just open index.html in a browser.
